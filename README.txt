WordPress Mobile Edition is a plugin that shows an interface designed for a mobile device when visitors come to your site on a mobile device.

Mobile browsers are automatically detected, there is no configuration needed. 

== Installation ==

1. Drop the wp-mobile.php file in your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Drop the wp-mobile directory in your wp-content/themes directory
3. Click the 'Activate' link for WordPress Mobile Edition on your Plugins page (in the WordPress admin interface)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this create a mobile admin interface too? =

No, it does not.


= Does this support pages too? =

Yes, it does.


= I visited the site in a mobile browser and my theme was reset to default, why? =

Probably because you missed step 2 in the installation directions above. If the requested theme is not available, WordPress will reset your theme to the default.


= Why are recent posts shown on every page? =

This is a feature of the plugin to allow easy access to recent content.


= My mobile device isn't automatically detected, what do I do? =
